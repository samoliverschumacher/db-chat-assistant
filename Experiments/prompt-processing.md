## Code Explanation: Prompt Processing for Database Query Matching with NLP

The provided code demonstrates how to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to match user prompts with entities in a database. The goal is to extract relevant information from the prompts and identify the corresponding tables and fields in the database.

### Dependencies

The code requires the following dependencies:

- `spacy`: A popular NLP library used for various NLP tasks, such as tokenization, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing.
- `fuzzywuzzy`: A library for fuzzy string matching, used to match tokens in the prompts with table and field names in the database.

### Database and Prompts

The code assumes the existence of a database with multiple tables. In the provided example, we have three tables: `employees`, `projects`, and `departments`. Each table has a set of fields associated with it.

The code also includes a list of example prompts that we want to match with the database entities. These prompts can be customized or extended as needed.

### NLP Processing Steps

The code performs the following NLP processing steps for each prompt:

1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: The code uses spaCy's NER capabilities to identify named entities in the prompt. It extracts entities and their corresponding labels (e.g., person, organization, date) from the prompt.

2. **Dependency Parsing**: The code utilizes spaCy's dependency parsing to analyze the syntactic structure of the prompt. It extracts the dependencies between tokens, such as subject-verb relationships or noun-modifier relationships.

3. **Relation Extraction**: The code extracts relations from the named entities identified in the prompt. In the provided example, it extracts relations for organizations (ORG) and geopolitical entities (GPE). This can be customized based on specific requirements.

4. **Coreference Resolution**: The code attempts to resolve coreferences in the prompt. However, please note that the provided code assumes the existence of a `coref` extension attribute for spaCy tokens. If this attribute is not available in the spaCy model, you may need to use a different model or implement coreference resolution separately.

5. **Matching Database Entities**: The code matches the tokens in the prompt with the table and field names in the database. It uses fuzzy string matching to find similarities between tokens and database entities. The similarity threshold can be adjusted as needed.

### Output

For each prompt, the code prints the following information:

- The original prompt.
- The extracted named entities and their labels.
- The dependencies between tokens.
- The extracted relations (e.g., organizations, geopolitical entities).
- The coreference resolution results (if available).
- The matched table names in the database.
- The matched field names in the database.

### Customization Options

- **Different spaCy Models**: The code uses the "en_core_web_sm" model by default. However, you can use different spaCy models. Simply replace `"en_core_web_sm"` with the desired model name when loading the spaCy model (`nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")`).

- **Coreference Resolution**: If your spaCy model does not support coreference resolution or the `coref` attribute is not available, you may need to use a different model or implement coreference resolution separately.

- **Similarity Threshold**: The code uses a similarity threshold of 80 for fuzzy string matching. You can adjust this threshold based on your specific needs. Higher thresholds will require closer matches, while lower thresholds will allow for more leniency in matching.
