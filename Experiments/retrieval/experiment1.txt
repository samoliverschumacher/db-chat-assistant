Answer


To answer the question "How much money did we make in Berlin?", you would need the following tables:

invoices: This table contains information about each invoice, including the total amount in dollars (Total) and the customer's billing information, such as BillingCity, which includes the city where the customer lives.
You would specifically need to focus on the BillingCity field in the invoices table to filter for invoices where the BillingCity is "Berlin". Once you have identified the invoices from Berlin, you can sum up the Total field to calculate how much money was made in Berlin.
