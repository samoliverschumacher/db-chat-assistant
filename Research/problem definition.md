### User Story

The problem we aim to address is the difficulty faced by non-data driven members of a company in effectively interacting with and deriving insights from data. Many employees, especially those without a strong background in data analysis or programming, struggle to access and interpret data to make informed decisions. This lack of data literacy hampers their ability to contribute meaningfully to data-driven discussions and hinders overall productivity and efficiency within the organization.

### Use Cases  
  
- Simple questions like;  
  - Which is the 5 biggest "x"  
  - What sorts of things can I learn from the data?  
  - What is something interesting in data table X?  
  - What is something interesting about semantic field A? (semantic field - not a literal field in a literal table, but a concept. i.e. info about a `user` might span multiple tables.)  
- Shallow analyses;  
  - Is the difference between group A and B statistically significant?  
  - Which customers has stopped interacting?  
  - What are some typical rows? i.e. perform clustering algorithm on the table.  
- Visualise;  
  - Something simple to present to other people later.  
- Inputs;  
  - I want a table that has columns A, B, C, and one row for each field "x".  
  - input a .csv to use in all other use cases.
